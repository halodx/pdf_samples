This is a Java Gradle project with two subprojects:

* create_form - Makes a PDF with a simple form in it
* populate__form - Populates the PDF created by create_form
* form_server - A server that populates a form based on a form post

The recommended way to build these is to install gradle and import the projects into eclipse.

Both projects use the Apache pdfbox library.
